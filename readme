Homework 4


This is a dynamic factorial web application in python.
It uses memcache for the fast processing to calculate factorial of large integers.
The other webservice is Google user management. It is very beneficial for user login and logout without using databases.

The application consists of a form with a submit button. This gives the user to enter any number
so that it gives the factorial. This uses the Get method which can be seen in the URL.
When the user enters 'f' in the URL it flushes the memcache.
